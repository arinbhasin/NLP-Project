This project explores public sentiment toward Indian political leaders — **Narendra Modi** and **Rahul Gandhi** — using Natural Language Processing (NLP). It analyzes text data collected from online reviews and comments to classify sentiments as **positive**, **negative**, or **neutral**.

The goal is to understand how public perception varies between the two leaders, offering insights into political discussions during election periods.

## 🔍 Key Features
- **Text Preprocessing:** Cleans and prepares raw text data from Excel files.
- **Sentiment Classification:** Uses NLP models and polarity scoring to determine sentiment.
- **Data Visualization:** Displays sentiment distribution through charts and plots.

## 🧠 Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Pandas**, **NumPy** for data handling
- **NLTK**, **TextBlob**, or **Scikit-learn** for NLP and sentiment analysis
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** for visualization

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset consists of real-world textual reviews stored in:
- `modi_reviews.xls`
- `rahul_reviews.xls`

Each file contains public opinions about one of the leaders, used for separate and comparative sentiment analysis.

## 🚀 How to Run
